# ETH Computer Vision Projects

## Introduction
Here you will find the course projects I completed for the Image Analysis
and Computer Vision masters course which I undertook in my first term of my year abroad 
at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
The topics covered include:

1. Image compression and reconstruction with PCA.
2. Image segmentation with kmeans.
3. 3D Stereo Image Reconstruction.
4. Image classification with pytorch using transfer learning.

## Structure
In each exercise there is a handout.ipynb file which is the main
file you probably want to look at.

## Results
Each exercise was pass or fail, with a baseline score required to pass.
I passed all exercises, often in the top 25% of the class (according to leaderboard results).
