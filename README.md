# ETH Computer Vision Projects

## Introduction
Here you will find the course projects I completed for the Image Analysis
and Computer Vision masters course which I undertook in my first term of my year abroad 
at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
The topics covered include:

1. Image compression and reconstruction with PCA.
2. Image segmentation with kmeans.
3. 3D Stereo Image Reconstruction.
4. Image classification with pytorch using transfer learning.
